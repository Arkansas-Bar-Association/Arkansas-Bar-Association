Hello, my name is Georgi Jefimov and I am a student at [Tallinn Polytechnic School](https://www.tptlive.ee/) studying software development. I am a junior software developer three years into the four year course. My technology stack involves Javascript, MySQL, Python, PHP, C#, and, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. Besides programming, I have a general interest in things that work, complicated things such as machinery, craftsmanship, or code.
